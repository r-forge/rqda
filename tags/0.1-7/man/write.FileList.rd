\title{Import a batch of files to the source table}
\description{
If import individual file to the project, you can do it by clicking import button in the Files Tab. 
Sometimes, you want to import a batch of files quickly, you can do it by command. This function is 
used to import a batch of files into the source table in the *.rqda file.
}
\usage{
write.FileList(FileList, encoding = .rqda$encoding, con = .rqda$qdacon, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{FileList}{A list. Each element of the list is the file content, and the \code{names(FileList)} are the respective file name.}
  \item{encoding}{ Don't change this argument.}
  \item{con}{ Don't change this argument.}
  \item{\dots}{ \code{\dots} is not used.}
}
\details{
The file content will converted to UTF-8 character before write to 
*.rqda. The original content can be in any suitable encoding, so you 
can inspect the content correctly; In other words,the better 
practices is to used the corresponding encoding (you can get a hint by 
\code{localeToCharset} function) to save the imported 
files.
}
\value{
 This function is used for the side-effects. No value is return.
