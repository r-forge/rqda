<h1>What is RQDA and its features?</h1>

<P>RDQA is a <A HREF="http://www.r-project.org/">R</A> package for Qualitative Data Analysis, a <B>free</B> qualitative analysis software application (<A HREF="License.html">New BSD style license</A>). It works both on the Windows, Linux/<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> and (probably) MacOS platforms. RQDA is an easy-to-use tool to assist in the analysis of textual data. At the present, it supports only plain text format data. All the information is stored in <A HREF="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</A> database via the R package of <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html">RSQLite</A>. The GUI is based on <A HREF="http://www.ggobi.org/rgtk2/">RGtk2</A>, via the aid of <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gWidgetsRGtk2/index.html">gWidgetsRGtk2</A>. It includes a number of standard Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis features. Besides, it seamlessly integrated with R, which means that a) statistical analysis on the coding is possible, and b) functions about data manipulation and analysis can be easily extended by writing R functions. To some extent, <B>RQDA and R makes an integrated platform for both quantitative and qualitative data analysis.</B>

<p>By the GUI, it can:
<li>Import documents from plain text
<li>Support non-English documents, Simplified Chinese Character is well-tested under Windows
<li>Character-level coding using codes
<li>Memos of documents, codes, coding, project, files and more
<li>Retrieval of coding, and easily back to the original file (ease the problem of segmentation)
<li>Single-file (*.rqda) format, which is basically SQLite database. Data are stored in UTF-8, so it should be portable
<li>Facilitator helps to categorize codes,which is key to theory building. I deliberately avoid using tree-like categorization
<li>Facilitator helps to categorize files
<li>There is a case category, which is crucial feature to bridge qualitative and quantitative research
<li>Search information about selected case from the Internet vis popup menu
<li>Temporary delete files and codes
<li> Rename the files,code, code category, case and others

<p>By R functions, it can:
<li>Show the temporary deletion files and codes
<li>Undo the temporary deletion
<li>Permanently erase the temporary deletion

<p>Other functions may be added with the development of the software in the future. Click <A HREF="ChangeLog.txt">here</A> to see the <B>new features</B>.

<h1>Installation</h1>

<li>Because RGtk2 depends on GTK+, you may need to install GTK+ before install RGtk2. For windows user, <A HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-2.10.11-win32-1.exe?modtime=1175123376&big_mirror=0">download</A> GTK+ and install it. For MacOS users, <A HREF="http://r.research.att.com/gtk2-runtime.dmg">download</A> GTK+ here and install it. For Debian-based Linux users, you may use <i>sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev</i> to install GTK+ library. For other Linux users, you may have to manually install GTK+, <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/download-linux.html"> download</A> the source tarball, and follow the <A HREF="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/gtk-building.html">instructions</A> of installation.

<p>RQDA is based on R, so you have to install R and relevant packages in
order to use RQDA.

<li>Go to <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</A>, download R and install it. For Linux and BSD users, you can download binary version of R or the sources. For Windows users, you can download the binary version of R from the <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">download page</A>. For MacOS users, download the binary version of R from the <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">download page</A>, More instruction about installing R is in the <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html">R Installation and Administration</A> Manual.

<li>Launch R (as usual applications under Windows; or by command $R within shell terminal under Linux and FreeBSD). Then, you can see the prompt &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;,which indicates that R is ready for further commands.

<li>Install relevant packages by R command: <I>install.packages(c("DBI","RSQLite","RGtk2","gWidgets","gWidgetsRGtk2"))</I> . 

<li>Install RQDA package: use command: <I>install.packages("RQDA",repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")</I>.

<li>Launch RQDA by command <I>library(RQDA)</I> from within R. Then you can see the RQDA GUI.









<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Under construction (contributions are more than welcome).

<p>Basic usage: 1. Open or create new project. 2. Import files. 3. Select a file and open it by click button open. 4. Add codes. 5. Select a codes, select text segment in the open file, and press button mark. Select the same text segment and click button Unmark, you can undo the action. 6. Do more coding as step 5. 7. Select a code and click button retrieval to see what text segments have been attached to that code.

<p>About memo buttons in the code tab: 1. C-memo is used to attach memo to a selected code. You can select a code then click C-memo button to view/add memo. 2. C2Memo is used to attach a memo to a coded segments. In the open file, you can see the coded segments (highlighted), select one segment, and click C2Memo, you can view/add memo to that coded-segment.

<p><B>Tips</B>
<br>1. Under Linux/FreeBSD, you should set the locale of R to UTF-8 to get a better support of non-English documents. In my FreeBSD box, I set the locale of R by this R command: <i>Sys.setlocale(locale = "zh_CN.UTF-8")</i>.
<br>2. When RDQA is launched, it is better to minimize the main window of R (e.g. Rgui, Rterm, terminal from which R is launched).
<br>3. Besides the C-Cat and F-Cat, you can use a trick to help organize files, codes list,and cases by using specific name rules. For example, if you name a group of codes with 1 as prefix and another group of codes with 2 as prefix, then you can click the triangle symbol in ther right-upper corners of the Codes List table, then the codes are sorted according to their prefix. Similar trick applies to others.
