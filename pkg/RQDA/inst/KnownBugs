* retreival() has a bug: can not always (sometimes it does) scroll to the right position when click the button of back. It is not reproducible, thus will not be fixed any soon.
* possible bug in merging two codes.
* under Ubuntu/Debian Squeez, R will crash if a handler calls gselect.list. One possible workrable is to use previous way by calling RunonSelected rather than gselect.list.
